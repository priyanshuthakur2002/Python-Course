1. Create three sets: set_a, set_b, and set_c. Find the common elements between them and store the result in a new set called common_elements.

2. Create a dictionary to count the occurrences of each word in the list words. For example:
	words = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple"]

3. Create a list called lst with some duplicate numbers. Use a set to count the unique elements in lst, and print the count.

4. Create a dictionary where each key is a frozenset representing a unique combination of three numbers, and the value is the sum of those numbers.

5. Create two sets, set1 and set2. Find the symmetric difference between them and store it in a set called sym_diff.
